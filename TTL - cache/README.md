Problem Statement: Design a low-level caching system that supports storing elements with a specified time-to-live (TTL)
and provides methods for adding elements to the cache and retrieving all elements along with their frequency count.

Requirements:

    1. The caching system should include the following methods:
        - put(key): Adds an element with the given key to the cache.
        - get(): Retrieves all elements in the cache along with their frequency count.
    
       2. Each element in the cache should have a time-to-live (TTL) defined.
    
       3. The following data structures should be used:
           - HashMap: To store elements as keys.
           - PriorityQueue: To store timestamps for each element when it is added to the cache.
    
       4. The system should handle concurrency and ensure thread safety.

Example Usage:

    Assuming a TTL of 2 seconds:
    
    1. Putting elements into the cache at specific timestamps:
        - put(A) at 1 second
        - put(B) at 1 second
        - put(A) at 2 seconds
        - put(A) at 3 seconds
    
       2. Retrieving elements from the cache:
           - If the get() method is called just after 2 seconds, the expected result should be: {A: 2, B: 1}
           - If the get() method is called just after 3 seconds, the expected result should be: {A: 2}
